# MKS22X-FinalProject
DownGradius:\n a harder version of Everwing but not quite up to Gradius Nes\n\n

***Monday 5/20/19*** (here we go!!!)\n
*Rachel*:\n
-Made classes, nothing works so far tho :(\n
*Elizabeth*:\n wrote player class methods: shoot, move, display(interim), and constructor.\n\n

***Tuesday 5/21/19*** \n
*Rachel*:\n
-Bullet can now display! No more issues with class doesn't exist errors\n
-Note to self: setup and draw are outside of classes\n\n
*Elizabeth*:\n
-move & shoot weren't working and I couldn't find out why\n\n

***Wednesday 5/22/19*** (time to cram bois)\n
*Rachel*:\n
-Created the Game constructor and started work on a new helper function "inRadius" to help with "inContact"
*Elizabeth*:\n
-move works!! The cause was because the game kept resetting. Created the abstract monster class.\n\n

***Thursday 5/23/19*** (APUSH exam aghhhhhh)\n
*Rachel*:\n
-Worked on Bullet's inRadius, distanceTo, and inContact
-Need to work on figuring out how to make the code less repetitive:\n maybe make a new abstract class
*Elizabeth*:\n
-Created Stan and worked on Stan methods\n
-Edited the game variables for more suitable names\n
-Made player move slower so that when the user presses the keys it doesn't fly out of the board immediately\n\n

***Friday 5/24/2019*** (AP CALC BC exam dkjgogiafhdk)\n
*Rachel*:\n
*Elizabeth*:\n
-Fixed Stan methods so stan would die outside of the board
-Created Tanky and its methods\n\n
