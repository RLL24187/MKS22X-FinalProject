# MKS22X-FinalProject
# Welcome and Intro
**DownGradius: <br /> It isn't quite like GradiusNes, but it's getting there. <br /> <br/>**
**Description: ** <br />
**DownGradius** is based on the old arcade game Gradius Nes. The Player (you!) controls a small plane which attempts to survive in a barrage of bullets from waves of monsters approaching in preprogrammed algorithms, based on the type of monster, in the opposite direction. By shooting these monsters, the player can increase his/her score and collect item drops which can help them progress further into the game. Once the player is hit by one of the bullets, either by monster or boss, or comes in contact with the monster or boss and loses all of its lives, the game is over, and the player restarts at the beginning with their score reset to 0. The objective of this game is to get the highest score.

**Directions:** <br />
Upon going to the menu, you can either start playing the game, look at the guide, or exit. 
To play, click the Start button and the game will commence immediately.
Move the player around using the arrow keys on your keyboard. 
Press the space bar to shoot bullets towards the monsters and hold down space for rapid fire. 
If you get hit by a monster's bullet or the monster, you will die. 
If your bullet hits the monster's bullets, they cancel each other out. 

**Items**
Sometimes monsters drop **Items**, either a **Coin**, **Shield**, or a **DoubleBullet**.
* Coin: (appears a yellow circle) Collecting coins boosts your score and its effect remains until the game is over.
* Shield: (appears a white circle) Temporarily provides protection against one Bullet or one encounter with a Monster
* DoubleBullet: (appears as a thin bullet) Temporarily allows the Player to shoot two Bullets at once

In order to collect those Items, you'll have to hover over to them. Item drops are programmed so they will disappear after a certain time. If you collect a Shield, it too will disappear after a certain time. The only exception to the above is Coins. 

GLHF!

# Development Log

***Monday 5/20/19*** (here we go!!!) <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Made classes, nothing works so far tho :( <br />

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Wrote Player class methods: shoot (in a straight line), move , display(interim), and constructor. <br /> <br />

***Tuesday 5/21/19***  <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Bullet can now display! No more issues with class doesn't exist errors <br />
* Note to self: setup and draw are outside of classes <br />

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* move & shoot weren't working and I couldn't find out why <br /> <br />

***Wednesday 5/22/19*** (time to cram bois) <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Created the Game constructor and started work on a new helper function "inRadius" to help with "inContact" <br />

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* move works!! The cause was because the game kept resetting. 
* Created the abstract monster class. <br /> <br />

***Thursday 5/23/19*** (APUSH exam aghhhhhh) <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Worked on Bullet's inRadius, distanceTo, and inContact <br />
* Need to work on figuring out how to make the code less repetitive: <br /> maybe make a new abstract class

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Created Stan and worked on Stan methods (move (in a straight line), display, constructor, etc) <br />
* Edited the game variables for more suitable names <br />
* Made player move slower so that when the user presses the keys it doesn't fly out of the board immediately <br /> <br />

***Friday 5/24/2019*** (AP CALC BC exam dkjgogiafhdk) <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Starting to implement a Collider class: inRadius, inContact, distanceTo <br />
* Added an ArrayList print method, helpful to see what is in the ArrayList<Collidable>
* Trying to work on die by adding to ArrayList<Killable> (list of dead things) and removing from ArrayList<Collidable> (list of alive things)<br />
* Changed parameters for die function, takes both killedList and collideList<br/>
* Had an issue with repeating Bullets in move, put adding the Bullet and Monster in setup rather than draw <br />
* Implemented polymorphism and inheritance: began using super methods <br />
* Made the README look better<br />

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Fixed Stan methods so stan would die outside of the board <br />
* Created Tanky and its methods:
* moves in a straight line
* displays as the largest monster
* constructor uses super monster class<br /> <br />

***Saturday 5/25/2019***<br />
*Rachel* üê¶:<br />
* Didn't do much today: had a wedding banquet to go to and errands to run :(<br />

*Elizabeth*:<br />
* Didn't do anything either, on vacay without laptop

***Sunday 5/26/2019***<br />
*Rachel* üê¶:<br />
* Updated parameters for methods in Collider
* Added Collider constructor
* Worked on distance, distanceTo, inRadius, and inContact in Collider
* Had a ConcurrentModificationException: lesson to be learned: don't use enhanced for loops when editing the ArrayList
* die is now a boolean method, still needs work
* Implemented inheritance with calls to super in Monster child classes <br />

*Elizabeth*:<br />
* Created player shooting so it wouldn't shoot multiple bullets at once when you press space once
* Edited the Stan and Tanky classes so there wouldn't be double methods of the same thing
* Worked on spawning the monsters and in the midst of creating a formation for the monster
* Tried to make the player move diagonally but wouldn't work: tried ArrayList and LinkedList but ended up getting NullPointerExceptions even when if I put (if != null) so I gave up and commented that out

***Monday 5/27/2019***<br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Fixed distance
* Worked on die: issue is that only one dies when both should die
* Player can now shoot

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Trying to add diagonal movement for player, failed
* Coding formation for monster (Stan and Tanky) and was failing, nothing was spawning


***Tuesday 5/28/2019*** <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* die now kills both objects and changes HP and checks it before killing
* Updated parameters for move
* changeHP added: returns new HP given the number to change it by
* Fixed constructors for classes
* inContact returns a Collider or null

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Worked on formation: tested out different ways like forming the top then bottom first but still didn't display and adding the list to the function as a variable and adding monster directly but it created an error
* Deleted the species section of the constructor in monster, stan, and tanky, rachel and i agreed that it would be unecessary 

***Wednesday 5/29/2019*** <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* die works with Bullet and Stan
* Noticed a bug. Monster always waits for Bullet to move first, so if there is more than one Bullet, Monster will seemingly disappear, but it is actually still there, just stagnant

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* formation  wasn't working even though the code had no errors and I found out why tomorrow
* So the error from yesterday was a cause of directly add monster, instead I added stan/tanky (the monster's constructor) in order to add

***Thursday 5/30/2019*** <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* die works with Tanky now
* formation fixed
* Optimized move and die
* Added Tiny
* Out of bounds dying boolean statements changed so that it'll only die when the whole object disappears from screen

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* the bug was that IT WAS SPAWNING IN THE WRONG SPOT bc I mixed up the input when constructing the monsters
* editing the player to move diagonally, finally working, I created an arraylist to track movement and iterim method buttons to add to the arraylist the correct movements


***Friday 5/31/2019*** <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Fixed up README to look nicer
* Edited out of bounds dying boolean for Bullet: dies when whole thing disappears
* Updated formation to handle different sizes
* Played with speeds and sizes of Monsters
* Found and fixed issue with inRadius: bug with killing square shaped Monsters
* Starting to put everything together: update is a method that spawns different monsters randomly, but in the same locations and at specific time intervals

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Worked on spawning and timing (added seconds to the game variable and random spawning)
* Trying to smooth out player but couldn't
* SAT subject tomorrow so I didn't work on it at home

***Saturday 6/1/2019*** <br />
*Rachel* üê¶: <br />
* Removed y bounds from die: mostly so Tiny doesn't die after oscilating too high
* Began randomizing ycor for spawning monsters
* Updated formations so it looks more interesting
* Took Mr. K's advice and added an angle parameter, movement is smoother now
* Added counters for spawning monsters

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* PLAYER IS NOW SMOOTH but also kinda choppy when going in opposite directions
* Also added monsters shooting from where they were

***Sunday 6/2/2019*** <br /> 
*Rachel*üê¶: <br />
* Adjusted frequency of monster spawning and better spread out their locations
* Cleaned up the code: update format and remove old comments
* Tried to get smooth movement... only got diagonal

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Added menu, mouse guided: click start to start, guide for instructions, and exit to exit with fancy buttons that change color when hovered over
* the menu background is from google image (idk if it's copyrighted or not)
* avatar doesn't lead anywhere bc we haven't implemented that yet
* Cleaned up player movement, now it is no longer choppy when going in opposite directions, i just chose whatever the player clicked last

***Monday 6/3/2019*** <br />
*Rachel*üê¶: <br />
* Fixed the blinking error: extra move was deleted
* Added Itemdrop, Coin, Shield, and DoubleBullet class
* Powerups work with time limits on when to collect and how long powers last

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Fixed monster spawn as they spawned outside of board
* Added images for monsters, player, and itemdrop found online (idk if it's copyrighted or not)
* Shield generates around player when collected, imgs are really tiny for item drop and certain monsters


***Tuesday 6/4/2019*** <br />
*Rachel*üê¶: <br />
* Fixed the menu and finalized instructions. 
* Fixed the Shield bug
* Got Player to die
* Updated Player's bullet interval
* Removed unnecessary classes

*Elizabeth*: <br />
* Fixed bugs like player's bullet killing each other during repeated shooting and monsters not dying
* Added bounds for player
* Tried to fix any remaining bugs and any that popped up
* Added a scoring counter and displayed coin counter
* Added a reset button when you died, press r to restart
* Took out the avator button from the menu
