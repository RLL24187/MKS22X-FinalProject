Rachel: Made classes, nothing works so far tho :(
Elizabeth: wrote player class methods: shoot, move, display(interim), and constructor.

Rachel: Bullet can now display! No more issues with class doesn't exist errors
Note to self: setup and draw are outside of classes
Elizabeth: move & shoot weren't working and I couldn't find out why

Elizabeth: move works!! The cause was because the game kept resetting. Created the abstract monster class.
