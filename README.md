# MKS22X-FinalProject
DownGradius: a harder version of Everwing but not quite up to Gradius Nes

***Monday 5/20/19***
Rachel: Made classes, nothing works so far tho :(
Elizabeth: wrote player class methods: shoot, move, display(interim), and constructor.

***Tuesday 5/21/19***
Rachel: Bullet can now display! No more issues with class doesn't exist errors
Note to self: setup and draw are outside of classes
Elizabeth: move & shoot weren't working and I couldn't find out why

***Wednesday 5/22/19***
Rachel: Created the Game constructor and started work on a new helper function "inRadius" to help with "inContact"
Elizabeth: move works!! The cause was because the game kept resetting. Created the abstract monster class.

***Thursday 5/23/19***
RaCheL:
-Worked on Bullet's inRadius, distanceTo, and inContact
-Need to work on figuring out how to make the code less repetitive: maybe make a new abstract class
Elizabeth:
-Created Stan and worked on Stan methods
-Edited the game variables for more suitable names
-Made player move slower so that when the user presses the keys it doesn't fly out of the board immediately

***Friday 5/24/2019***
Rachel:
Elizabeth:
-Fixed Stan methods so stan would die outside of the board
-Created Tanky and its methods
