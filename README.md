# MKS22X-FinalProject
DownGradius: a harder version of Everwing but not quite up to Gradius Nes

5/20/19
Rachel: Made classes, nothing works so far tho :(
Elizabeth: wrote player class methods: shoot, move, display(interim), and constructor.

5/21/19
Rachel: Bullet can now display! No more issues with class doesn't exist errors
Note to self: setup and draw are outside of classes
Elizabeth: move & shoot weren't working and I couldn't find out why

5/22/19
Rachel: Created the Game constructor and started work on a new helper function "inRadius" to help with "inContact"
Elizabeth: move works!! The cause was because the game kept resetting. Created the abstract monster class.
